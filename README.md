# Titular Royalty ![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/CanonOverseer/Rimworld-Titular-Royalty-Mod) [![RimWorld 1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.4-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)](http://rimworldgame.com/)
 
 A mod for Rimworld aiming to add Royalty DLC titles to the player's faction for roleplaying purposes.

## Features
- Grant your pawns titles at any throne or with the Staff of Royalty (warranty void if used as bashing weapon)
- Preset custom title lists, based off real noble or imperial titles
- Mod Settings to change between title sets and enable or disable certain features
- Custom Title Names available at any throne or via the debug menu

## How to use Custom Titles
1. Use the "Title Manager" button at any Vanilla (patches can be made for modded) Throne, then press rename on the title you want to change, press update titles to refresh the list so it applies in game.
2. If you subscribed before the update make sure steam has updated the mod, you can tell because the preview image has changed in the modlist


## Notes
- Known Incompatibilities right now are mods with scenarios that have the player faction not inheriting from "PlayerFactionBase" and these would need a manual patch made by me or them because they would not have any titles added to them.
- Currently only Antinium has been patched this way

## Plans
- Shattered Empire, Caliphate, Russian and Nordic titles
- Permits System
- Improved Codebase
- Advanced Inheritance System that works similarly to real inheritance with choose-able succession laws
